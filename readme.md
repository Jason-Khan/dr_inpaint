# Diminished Reality using Inpainting methods - SwinUPer Inpaintor

Class final project for Spring 2021 CS280 Computer Vision, UC Berkeley.  
Our implementation of SwinUPer builds on top of [mmediting](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmediting).
Full commit history of SwinUPer is available [here](https://github.com/Jason-Khan/mmediting).
For semantic segmentation used in our Diminished Reality pipeline, we used [mmsegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation).
